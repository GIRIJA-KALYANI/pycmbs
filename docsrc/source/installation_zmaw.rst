Detailed installation instructions for MPI-M users
==================================================



ZMAW users
----------

For users working at the ZMAW (KlimaCampus, Hamburg), the usage of pyCMBS is straightforward. Nothing has to be installed! You just need to login into your shell and load the pyCMBS module as follows ::

    module load pyCMBS/default

That's it. This sets also automatically the settings for the *PYTHONPATH* and *SEP* environment variables which are needed.

Please check if anything is working like described below_.
