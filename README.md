What is pyCMBS?
---------------

pyCMBS has two major objectives:

A) pyCMBS provides a suite of tools to process, analyze, visualize geoscientific data and climate model output.

B) It has been explicitly designed to facilitate the becnhmarking of scientific model output against each other or against observational reference data. It is in particular useful for analyzing in an efficient way output from climate model simulations.
