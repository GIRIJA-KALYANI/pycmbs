# CHANGES

 * `examples` -- need explicit import statements
 * `framework` has been moved out of pycmbs library and renamed to `benchmarking`
 * `tools` contents have been moved to `../scripts` directory as they are effectively scripts
 *  tests have to be written for ~17 pycmbs submodules

# ISSUES
 * a lot of comments in the code
 * some multitask tests can be split into single method test with single assertion statement

# QUESTIONS
 * shall `benchmarking` be a part of pycmbs or a standalone project?
 * shall `colormaps` be a regular pycmbs submodule?

# SUGGESTIONS
 * increase test coverage (only four submodules are test covered, also incompletely)
