Getting started
===============

There are several ways to get started with pyCMBS.

1. :doc:`gallery`
2. RECOMMENDED: a first pycmbs session with example data is provided in an ipython notebook in the `demo` folder. This can be also viewed `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pygeo/pycmbs/blob/master/demo/pyCMBS-Basics.ipynb>`_
3. examples provided within the source code
4. in code documentation. Use the python help() to view the docstrings.
