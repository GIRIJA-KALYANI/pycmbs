version 0.1.1
============================
o implemented support for different calendars using netcdftime library provided in netCDF4 library. COPYRIGHT has been
  changed accordingly. Note that a major refactoring was needed for that purpose.
  NOTE all files written with older versions pyCMBS might now show a timeshift of one day! This is due to
  an artefact in the pylab num2date/date2num functions which provide the number of days relative to 0001-01-01 *PLUS ONE*
  (see num2date documentation). The new routines have not this artefact.
  Do allow for backward compability with v0.1.0, an option 'oldtime' has been added to Data object, which mimics the old
  behavior.
o initial support for ICON generic unstructured grid. There are still some workarounds for plotting the unstructured data,
  but in general it works well.

version 0.1.0 (= rev240)
============================
o initial version released with major data analysis and benchmarking features already included
